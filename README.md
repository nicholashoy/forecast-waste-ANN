# Forecasting Malaysia's solid waste generation using a Bayesian-optimized artificial neural network with ensemble learning for improved generalization

- The code for the Bayesian-optimized artificial neural network is written in MATLAB (.mlx). 
- To run the code, place the data files (.xlsx) in the same directory as the .mlx file.
- Here, the Data1.xlsx to Data8.xlsx files contain the historical data used to train and test the accuracy of the neural network, where each file corresponds to a single type of solid waste composition (e.g., food, plastic, paper).
- The Forecast1.xlsx to Forecast8.xlsx files contain the projected socioeconomic data to forecast the solid waste generations. Since each solid waste composition are strongly correlated to different socioeconomic indicators, the socioeconomic data which are used as their corresponding predictors are different, as shown in the files.
